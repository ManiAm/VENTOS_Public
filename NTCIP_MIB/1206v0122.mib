DcmRowStatus ::= INTEGER
{
 active (1), 
 notInService (2),
 notReady (3),
 createAndGo (4),
 createAndWait (5),
 destroy (6)
}
--This object is intended to provide the same functionality as the RowStatus
-- object defined in SNMPV2.  It shall operate in the same manner as defined
-- in SNMPV2.
--
--The 'action' states can be written, but not read:
--createAndGo: indicates that the agent should accept the row values
-- specified,create items within the row and place the row into service (or 
-- activate it)
--
--createAndWait: indicates that the agent should accept the values specified
-- (if any) and, create items within the row, but not place the row 
-- in service. 
--
--destroy:  indicates that the agent should remove the row from service and 
-- then delete it.
--
--The 'desired' states can be written and read:
--notInService: indicates that the row has been suspended. That is, the 
-- row does not exist.
--
--active: indicates that the row exists and can be used.
--
--The 'current' state can only be read:

--Indicates a unique number assigned to each physical IO channel in the 'dcm 
-- Physical To Logical IO Mapping Table.  It provides a link to this IO

-- 2.2.10 Array Number (DcmArrayNum)
DcmArrayNum ::= INTEGER (1..255)

--This object represents a unique number for each sensor array that is defined

 maxVehicleLength (5),
 wimCalFactor (6),
 calFilePointer (7),
 arraySpeedCal (8)
}
--Indicates the type of parameter associated with an array. One or more types 
--can be associated with an array.  The values are:
-- other (1),= not defined below.
-- maxAxleSpacing (2),= The longest axle spacing (in millimeters) that would 
-- be expected on any vehicle to traverse the array.  This parameter is 
-- typically used to end a vehicle if there is no presence sensor used in the -- array.
-- vehicleAxleRatio (3),= The number of detected axles which shall be considered to 
--  constitute a vehicle.  This parameter is typically used in arrays that can
--  only detect axles. 
-- singleAxleTimeout (4)= The amount of time from the last axle strike (in 
--  milliseconds) that must elapse before another axle strike to end a 
--  vehicle.  This parameter is typically used with arrays that do not use a 
--  presence sensor to separate vehicles or cannot calculate a speed to use 
--  the maxAxleSpacing parameter.
-- maxVehicleLength (5),= This parameter defines the maximum expected vehicle 
--  length (in mm) to traverse the sensor array.  It is typically used to end 
--  a vehicle in a situation where  the sensor used to calculate vehicle 
--  length may be stuck on.
-- wimCalFactor (6),= This parameter defines a multiplier (0.000 to 65.535) to 
--  be applied to weights calculated by an array.  This is a discrete number 
--  and has no units.
-- calFilePointer (7)= The file name specified in the dcmParameterFileName 
--  points to a file containing implementation-specific calibration parameters 
-- (e.g. classification scheme, WIM autocalibration scheme).  object. The 
--  value of the dcmParameterValue shall be ignored. 
-- arraySpeedCal (8) = this enumeration was added to allow encoding of an 
--  array speed calibration change (refer to dcmArraySpeedCalFactor in the 
--  'Array Speed Calibration Table') to be encoded into the 'Array Parmater 
--  Change Record Table' and written to a dcm data file. It shall not be used 
--  in this table."

-- 2.2.12 Array Parameter Value (DcmArrayParamValue)
 DcmArrayParamValue ::= INTEGER (0..16777215)

--Indicates the value associated with an array parameter type as 
-- specified by a DcmArrayParamType object.  The acceptable value ranges and 
-- units differ depending on the value of the dcmParameterType object value.  
-- The acceptable values and UNITs per parameter type are: 
-- maxAxleSpacing = 0 to 65535 in millimeter
-- vehicleAxleRatio = 1.00 to 655.35 as a divisor (e.g., 2.00 specifies that 2 
--  axles constitute 1 vehicle)
-- singleAxleTimeout = 0 to 65535 in milliseconds
-- maxVehicleLength = 0 to 65535 in millimeters
-- wimCalFactor = 0.000 to 100.000 as a multiplier
-- calFilePointer = The DcmArrayParamValue is meaningless when the 
--  DcmArrayParamType object is set to 'calFilePointer'.  The 
--  DcmArrayParamFileName object should be read to obtain an octet string 
--  identifying the name of a file which contains implementation-specific 
--  calibration factors.  
-- arraySpeedCal= Refer to dcmArraySpeedCalFactor in the 'Array Speed 
--  Calibration Table'

-- 2.2.13 Array Parameter File Name (DcmArrayParamFileName)
DcmArrayParamFileName ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE (0..255))

--Indicates a file name that contains array parameter calibration information. 
-- This information is most likely implementation-specific.  The value of this 
-- object is only meaningful, if the value of the Array Parameter Type 
-- (dcmAPType) object is set to 'calFilePointer', otherwise this value shall 
-- be ignored.

-- 2.2.14 Filter Number (DcmFilterNum)
DcmFilterNum ::= INTEGER (1..255)

--This object indicates a filter number assigned to filters defined within 
-- this dcm device from the 'dcm Filter Configuration Table'.

-- 2.2.15 Study Number (DcmStudyNum)
DcmStudyNum ::= INTEGER (1..255)

--This object represents a unique number for each study that is defined within 
-- the dcm device in the 'dcm Study Configuration Table'.  It is recommended 
-- to assign this value sequentially, however when studies are deleted, there 
-- could be gaps in the indexes.  It is recommended to use the deleted study 
-- number as the next one to assign as an attempt to keep these indexes 
-- sequential.

-- 2.2.16 File Study Index (DcmFileStudyIndex)
DcmFileStudyIndex ::= INTEGER (0..255)

--Identifies a file structure number defined within the 'dcm File Structure 
-- Table'.  A value of zero (0) indicates that no data shall be recorded and 
-- the study is to be used for Monitor Modes.

-- 2.2.17 File Structure Number (DcmFileStrucNum)
DcmFileStrucNum ::= INTEGER (1..255)

--This object points to a defined file structure in the 'dcm File Structure 
-- Table'.  It is highly recommended that the application try to keep this 
-- number sequential (reuse numbers that have been deleted).

-- 2.2.18 Binned Filter Number (DcmBinnedFilterNum)
DcmBinnedFilterNum ::= INTEGER (1..255)

--This object represents a unique number for each binned filter that has been 
-- defined in the 'dcm Binned Filter Definition Table) within the device.  It 
-- is strongly suggested that the numbering is assigned sequentially.  This 
-- number can never exceed the maximum number of bins for all studies object 
-- (dcmMaxNumBins).

-- 2.3 VEHICLE CRITERIA NODE
--DCM Vehicle Criteria Node
dcmVehCriteria OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {dcm 1}

-- This node identifies the parameters that are used to define vehicle 
--  criteria that can be used to configure Binned Studies, PVR Studies and 
--  Filters.  

-- These parameters are not intended to be  manipulated directly by an 
--  application.  They are defined to allow assignment of an OID to reference 
--  them in other places.  They are defined in this section because they were
--  not required to be defined as regular objects elsewhere in this standard.

-- Objects defined as an Integer can be used in the Filter Config Table and 
--  the Binned Filter Definition Table.  Objects of any type can be used 
--  in the PVR Study Configuration Table.  

-- Even though an object is defined in this node, a device may not allow 
--  using that object in one of the stated tables (as it may not be sensible).  
--  The device shall return a dcm application error code of 'invalidOption'
--  for any object not allowed in one of the tables.  
-- The Vehicle Criteria Table shall indicate which vehicle parameters
--  (both within this MIB and externalto this MIB) are supported and for
--  what application (Binned Studies, PVR Studies or filters).

-- Note that objects that are only defined as elements of a table 
--  (e.g. Array Number (DcmArrayNum)) may also be used within the 
--  Vehicle Criteria Table.  The OID's for these type of objects should
--  be taken from the table from which that object is first defined
--  (e.g. Array Number is first defined in the Logical IO To Array Map Table
--   as dcmIOAMArrNum).  Therefore if Array Number is supported by this
--  device, then the OID for dcmIOAMArrNum should be used in the 
--  Vehicle Criteria Table.  Other objects (within this standard) included 
--  in this category are dcmPLMLogIONum and dcmFCFilterNum. The controller
--  local time zone object from the Global Objects (1201-2.4.7, 
--  controller-localTime) is also included in this category.

-- Each object defined in this section can be either a single-occurrence or
--  multi-occurrence object when used to configure a PVR Study.  
-- A single-occurrence object has only one instance when stored in the PVR 
--  data (such as vehicle speed).  
-- A multi-occurrence object shall consist of multiple occurrences of
--  the object (such as axle weights).
-- Unless otherwise specified, all objects shall be defined as a 
--  single-occurrence object.

-- A single-occurrence object  has only one instance of the 
--  defined parameter in the PVR structure, it shall be encoded as [(value)].
--  The length of the 'value' is specified by the  definition of the object.  
--  (e.g. if an object is defined as INTEGER (1..65535), it must always be
--  stored using two octets). There must always be that number of octets 
--  used to store this parameter (even if the value can be represeneted 
--  in less octets).  
-- A multi-occurrence object  may have more than one instance 
--  of the defined parameter in the PVR structure.  This encoding shall always
--  start with a single octet to specify the number of occurrences for 
--  this parameter (cannot exceed 255 occurrences of any parameter).  
--  The multiple occurrences for this parameter must 
--  be stored sequentially (e.g. if axle spacings then axsp1, axsp2, axsp3 …).  
--  The length of each value is specified in the definition of the object
--   and all occurrences of this parameter must be the same length.  
--   The number of occurrences octet may be set to 0 to indicate that 
--   there are no parameters of this type stored.  This encoding allows 
--   Pvr Record 1 to specify 5 axle weights for a truck and Pvr Record 2 
--   to only specify 2 axle weights for a car.  The encoding becomes:
--   [(# of occurrences=n)(value 1)(value 2)…(value n)].

-- For either single or multi-occurrence objects, if the specified object 
--  is an integer, the value field shall only consist of the data without
--  a tag or length field as defined in BER encoding.  If the specified
--  object is an octet string, it shall be stored with a tag and length field
--  as defined by BER encoding for octet strings.  A BER "NULL" may be
--  used in place of any octet string object that could not be determined
--  by the device.  This allows for specifying multiple instances of octet 
--  strings of varying sizes.  A "NULL" is used as opposed to specifying 
--  an OCTET STRING of size 0 octets because an OCTET STRING of size 0
--  octets may be a valid value for the specified parameter.

 DESCRIPTION
 "This table maps logical IO's to a unique event number within a particular study.  The parameters allow defining the structure of each event data that is to be recorded.  An event is defined as a specific state of a logical IO and given a unique event # for a particular study.  The parameters are  related to a particular study number to allow for multiple structures for the same input.
An IO event record as stored in the data portion of an event data packet would consist of an Event # (dcmEventNum), Event Value (# of bits specified by dcmEventValueSize), Timestamp (# of bits specified by dcmTimestampSize).  The size of the IO event would be the sum of the Event # Size (dcmEventNumberSize), Event Value Size (dcmEventValueSize) and the Timestampsize (dcmTimestampSize).
Therefore to decipher the bitstream in an event record, the  first x bits (dcmEventNumberSize) of each data element would identify the Event Number and this table would define how many bits follow for the event value and event timestamp.
This is a single-indexed table. The index is assigned sequentially and the table requires row administration.  There shall be one row in this table for each event # mapped to an event study.
The table can be managed thru the dcmEventConfigRowAdmin object."

Although dcmEventNumber could be used as the second index, it would require a larger number of bits to store an event since an index cannot be assigned a value of zero and thus would have to start at one.  For example, a study with two events (Event # 1, Event # 2, (note that Event # 0 cannot be used)) would have to use two bits in each event record rather than one (two bits are required to represent the number 2 for Event # 2).  Using Event Config # as a separate index provides for the least number of bits to be stored in the event data record."

 "This table is single-indexed by study number.  
It is used to control and read the state of each 'Monitor Study'.
A Binned Monitor Study shall return the bin counts for the current recording interval as defined by the 'Data' column of the Data Structure Table for Binned Data (note that in asciiData Monitor Modes, the number of octets per binned count is not sent).
A PVR Monitor Study shall return one or more PVR/s as defined by the 'Data' column of the Data Structure Table for PVR Data (note that in asciiData Monitor Modes, the dcm device may translate the vehicle time tag to a more user friendly format (e.g. 'mm/dd/yy hh:mm:ss').
An Event Monitor Study shall return one or more sensor events (Logical IO Events) as defined by the 'Data' column of the Data Structure Table for Event Data (note that in asciiData Monitor Modes, the ascii hex representation of each event record field will be sent since event records are defined in bits).
The 'Data' column of the Data Structure Table is an OCTET STRING, it will contain the length of the data returned by the device for each type of Monitor Mode 2 (binary data).  The OCTET STRING identifier and length field is not included for asciiData Monitor Modes.  
Note that it may possible for vehicles or sensor events (Logical IO events) to be missed if the device does not have sufficient buffer space to hold the data before being polled (specifically in Monitor Mode 2).  This should only occur with either PVR or Event Monitor Studies.  There currently is no mechanism to notify the central application that a data over-run has occurred.  The best approach (if possible) would be to use Monitor Mode 1 allowing the device to stream out the data as it occurs.  This however requires that the central application can keep up with the streamed data.
Monitor Studies are typically used to verify operation of sensors and sensor arrays.
For example, if the data in collected data files appear to be invalid, a user may want to configure an 'Event Monitor Study' (in the Study Configuration Table) that incorporates the same sensors in which the invalid data has been produced by.  The user would then enable the 'Event Monitor Mode' from within this table.  The user would examine the event data returned by the device to determine if all of the specified sensors appear to be operating correctly.
Monitor Studies are typically turned on for a short period of time and then disabled.  The data is sent to a hardware communications port and not saved to a data file.
The study specified in this table must point to a 'Monitor Study'.  A 'Monitor Study' is defined as any study that has been configured in the Study Configuration Table with it's 'Study File Index' set to 0. 
The asciiData Monitor Modes are intended to provide user-readable output without interpretation and is included for historical purposes.
The Row Admin field is not required in this table.  If a study is deleted from the Study Configuration Table, the device shall also delete any row associated with the same study number from this table."

 DESCRIPTION
 "Indicates the encoding of the data packet returned by the device.  The values are:
-other(1)=not defined.

-asciiData(2)=data packet is encoded using an ascii representation of the 'Data' column of the Data Structure Table.  This mode of operation is intended to provide the user with readable data directly from the device without requiring interpretation (it is included for historical purposes).  Each field of the data packet (a defined bin for a binned study, a pvr parameter for a pvr study, or each field of an event record for an event study) shall be separated by a 'white space' (either an ascii space, ascii comma, ascii tab).  Each record (all of the binned counts for a binned study, each set of vehicle parameters for a pvr study and each logical IO event record for an event study), will be terminated by a 'white terminator' (an ascii carriage return, an ascii line feed or a combination ascii carriage return/line feed). Because each field is separated by an ascii 'white space', the dcn device may choose to pad each field with leading ascii zeros (ascii code h30) to make each identical field the same length for readability.  The octet string code (04h) and the length of the octet string fields are not sent in asciiData mode.  The number of octets per binned counts for binned studies is not sent.  The vehicle time tag for pvr studies may be translated by before being sent. The data fields sent for event studies shall be the ascii hex representation of each defined field since event records are defined in bits.
